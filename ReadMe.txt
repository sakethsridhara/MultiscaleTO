This is supplementary MATLAB code for the article "Spectral Decomposition for Topology Optimization using graded-microstructures"

The code must be run using gMTO.m script section-wise.
1. Run the first two sections (clear previous variables and set path).
2. Set the microstructure and optimization parameters in section 3.
3. Run section 3 (user-defined parameter) and section 4 (default parameters).
4. If the Spectral Decomposition method is to be used run section 5 and section 6
5. Otherwise for direct regression method run section 7 and 8.
6. If the section 5 and 7, both have been executed for a microstructure, an R^2 comparison is possible using section 9.
